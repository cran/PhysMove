#' Randomise tracks
#'
#' This function allows you to investigate the influence spatial and/or temporal correlations may have on an individuals' space use patterns.
#' This is done by maintaining the origin and end location of each track, randomizing the order displacements occurred in between these points,
#' and calculating how many grid cells the original and randomised tracks visited, which summarizes their space use.
#' @param species_df A data frame containing location data in rows. Columns have the following headers: "ref", "lon", "lat", "day".
#' "ref" is the unique id number for each animal (e.g., their satellite tag number formatted as an integer),
#' "lon" and "lat" are the longitude and latitude of each position estimate in decimal degrees in numeric format,
#' "day" is the datetime stamp for each location estimate in POSIXct format following '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'.
#' See attached sample data \code{\link{tracks}}.
#' @param randTrack Number of randomised tracks per individual. Default is 100.
#' @param gridCell Grid cell size in degrees. Default is 0.25.
#' @param plot Plot the number of cells visited in the original track versus the average number of cells visited in the
#' reshuffled tracks. Default is TRUE.
#' @param lm Calculate a linear regression to examine the relationship between the number of cells visited in the original tracks
#' (target variable) and the average number of cells visited by the Randomised tracks (predictor variable). If plot = TRUE this parameter
#' adds a solid black fit line to the data points and a black dashed line, which represents a 1:1 relationship. The slope of the fit line can
#' be determined by typing 'RandomiselinearModel$coefficients[2]'. Default is TRUE.
#' @return List containing a dataframe of results (list element 1), the randomised longitude and latitude values (list elements 2 and 3, respectively),
#' which are needed for the \code{\link{plotRandomTracks}} function, and if lm = TRUE, the results of the linear model are output (list element 4).
#' The dataframe of results includes columns for the number of cells visited by each original track and the average number of cells visited by the
#' Randomised tracks for each ref. Lastly, if plot = TRUE, a plot illustrating the number of cells visited by the original and randomised tracks is created,
#' and if lm = TRUE, a fit line and reference line are added to the plot.
